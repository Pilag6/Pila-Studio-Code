 # Pila Studio Code

Attention all developers and designers! Have you ever wanted to create your own code editor, just like Codepen? 

Well, I have recently completed a design for a code editor made entirely with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

With this tool, you can create and edit code in a similar fashion to popular platforms like Codepen. The best part is that it's easy to make. 

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, I encourage you to give it a try and see for yourself the possibilities that can be achieved with a little creativity and some basic web development skills.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback, and even better, I welcome any pull requests on my Github repository. 

Let's create something great together!
